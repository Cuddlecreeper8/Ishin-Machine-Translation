0x00e25ec8;Bandits are all strong. [n] Let's do our best not to be revenge.
0x00e25f10;The ability of the soldier can be used with the [n] <Sign:7> + arrow keys when the filling gauge in the above figure is full.
0x00e25f60;The filling speed is determined by the filling speed of the soldiers and the result of [n] Captain Saito's fighting style. Not only can you grow [n] soldiers, but you can also increase the morale of [n] soldiers by fighting well, and shorten the time it takes to use [n] abilities.
