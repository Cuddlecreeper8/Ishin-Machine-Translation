# Ishin-Machine-Translation
Myself and @Timo654 made a machine translated and super sketchy translation of Yakuza: Ishin

Foas is doing obvious fixes  

psp in the Yakuza Modding server and cat-three (my friend!) for help with UI elements :)

zarroboogs for helping extract text from eboot

SutandoTsukai181's eboot script with heavy modifications from Timo654 and Myself

Kaplas80 for their amazing tool that allowed us to create this

KHHSubs for Trophy translations

MsLow for a bunch of nutty stuff!

# The Digital Version is recommended as it allows changes to the AUTH folder with a patch, whereas Disc version doesn't

## Untested on hardware!!!

## How to use:

### REQUIREMENTS!
# pip install -r requirements.txt

## autoupdate
autoupdate.py will create a patched and encrypted eboot, use resigner to build a new pkg!

## translate_google
Will translate all text in original (po files)
