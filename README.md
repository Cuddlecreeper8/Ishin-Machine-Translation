# Ishin-Machine-Translation

A machine translated and super sketchy translation of Yakuza: Ishin, by GarnetSunset and Timo654.
Feel free to contribute with any fixes or additions.

# The Digital Version is recommended as it allows changes to the AUTH folder with a patch, whereas Disc version doesn't

## Untested on hardware!!!

## How to use:

### REQUIREMENTS!
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

### autoupdate

autoupdate.py will create a patched and encrypted eboot, use resigner to build a new pkg, will be automated in the future
