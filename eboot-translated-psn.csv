0x00e25ef8;At the beginning of the mission, the physical strength will be added to [n] Captain Saito according to the total physical strength of the soldiers.
0x00e25f48;Bandits are all strong. [n] Let's do our best not to be revenge.
0x00e25f90;The ability of the soldier can be used with the [n] <Sign:7> + arrow keys when the filling gauge in the above figure is full.
0x00e25fe0;The filling speed is determined by the filling speed of the soldiers and the result of [n] Captain Saito's fighting style. Not only can you grow [n] soldiers, but you can also increase the morale of [n] soldiers by fighting well, and shorten the time it takes to use [n] abilities.
0x00e26098;Now let's use Goro Narita's [n] soldier ability with [n] <Sign:7> + <Sign:43>.
0x00e260e8;Now, the ability of Goro Narita has been activated. [n] This ability has the effect of "restoring health" [n], so you can benefit from it for a certain period of time.
0x00e26160;You can check the remaining time of this ability effect with the [n] Soldier's filling gauge on the right side of the screen. [n] The effect is over when the filled gauge is exhausted.
0x00e261e8;You can [n] instruct the soldiers to activate the ability automatically, but what do you do? [n] [n] <Sign:D> Leave it to the soldiers <Sign:C> Activate by yourself
0x00e26268;This setting can be changed from the reception desk, so if you want to change it [n], please talk to the reception desk.
